# MaZe

This project aims to create a containerized app (Docker) hosted on a free platform. It uses Folium and FastAPI to generate a heatmap for a user-selected city. 

The user can adjust the importance of various features (supermarket, bakery, metro, bus stop, rent prices) via a sidebar to find the optimal location for buying a house based on their preferences.
